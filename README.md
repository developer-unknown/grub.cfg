# grub.cfg
You can edit the grub.cfg file in your bootable Ubuntu CD/USB and make it say something else.
For example, there is a list when you boot from your CD/USB and the options will be:

*Ubuntu
*Ubuntu (safe graphics)
*OEM INSTALL
*UEFI FIRMWARE SETTINGS

You can edit the text in the grub.cfg file to make for instance "Ubuntu" say "MacOS" to trick someone.
